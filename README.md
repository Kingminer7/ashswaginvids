# running it

so basically im bad at explanations
this is what ill put tho

make sure you have python (version 3.11.1 is what i coded it with so i recommend that).

so first set up a bot and get the consumer key, consumer secret, access token, access token secret, and bearer token.
if you dont know how just find a tutorial.
then download the code. unzip it and run install_deps.bat. put the consumer key, consumer secret, access token, access token secret, and bearer token into the config.json file.
now run run.bat

the bot should have started. i semi added emergency restart by restarting the bot by making run.bat open when it fails
